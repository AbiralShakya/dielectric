### **[0:00-0:20] Hook: The Problem**

> "PCB designers struggle with thermal failures that cost the industry $1B+ annually in rework. Current tools use heuristics and black-box AI - engineers can't verify why decisions were made. We need mathematical rigor, not guesswork."

**Visual**: Show thermal failure statistics, black-box AI problem

### **[0:20-0:50] Innovation: Computational Geometry**

> "We've built Dielectric using computational geometry algorithms - rigorous mathematical structures that capture spatial relationships in PCB layouts. We use Voronoi diagrams to partition the PCB plane optimally around component centers, creating a mathematical representation of component territories. We use Minimum Spanning Trees to find the optimal connection structure that minimizes total trace length. We use Gaussian thermal models based on heat transfer equations to predict temperature distribution. These aren't heuristics - these are proven algorithms with mathematical guarantees."

### **[1:20-1:45] AI Integration: Geometry Enables Explainable AI**

> "We feed these geometric data structures to xAI Grok for reasoning.

This makes AI decisions explainable - engineers can verify our Voronoi calculations, check our MST edges, validate our thermal models. We're bridging symbolic AI - the rigorous mathematics of computational geometry - with neural AI - the adaptive reasoning of xAI. This is the first system to do this for PCB design."

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### **❌ DON'T:**
1. **Focus on speed**: Don't emphasize "2,000× faster" - focus on mathematical rigor
2. **Oversimplify math**: Don't say "we use math" - say "we use Voronoi diagrams with O(n log n) complexity"
3. **Claim magic**: Don't say "we solve NP-hard optimally" - say "we use proven algorithms for spatial analysis"
4. **Ignore verification**: Don't skip the explainability aspect
5. **Rush through math**: Take time to explain why computational geometry matters

### **✅ DO:**
1. **Emphasize mathematical rigor**: "Proven algorithms", "mathematical guarantees"
2. **Show research foundation**: Cite specific papers (Fortune, Kruskal, Holman)
3. **Explain complexity**: Mention O(n log n), optimal substructure
4. **Show explainability**: "Engineers can verify our calculations"
5. **Be specific**: "Voronoi variance = 0.15" not "good distribution"

## 💬 Handling Questions

### **"How is this different from heuristics?"**
> "Heuristics are rules of thumb with no guarantees. We use proven algorithms - Voronoi diagrams use Fortune's O(n log n) algorithm that's mathematically proven optimal for spatial partitioning. MST uses Kruskal's algorithm that's optimal for minimum total distance. These have mathematical guarantees, not just 'good enough' solutions."

### **"Why computational geometry?"**
> "Computational geometry provides rigorous mathematical structures that capture spatial relationships. Voronoi diagrams create optimal spatial partitions, MST finds optimal connections, Gaussian models use actual thermal physics. These are interpretable - engineers can verify our calculations independently, unlike black-box AI."

### **"How do you handle NP-hard placement?"**
> "PCB placement is NP-hard, so we use heuristics for full optimization. But we use proven, optimal algorithms for spatial analysis - Voronoi, MST, Convex Hull - with mathematical guarantees. Then we use these optimal geometric insights to guide our placement heuristics intelligently. It's optimal algorithms where possible, intelligent heuristics where necessary."

### **"What makes this explainable?"**
> "Our geometric metrics are interpretable. Voronoi variance = 0.15 means uniform distribution - engineers can verify this calculation. MST length = 125mm means optimal trace routing estimate - engineers can check our edge list. Thermal hotspots are identified using Gaussian physics - engineers can validate our model. This is verifiable mathematics, not black-box AI."

### **"How do you know these algorithms work?"**
> "All our algorithms are from peer-reviewed research. Fortune 1987 proved Voronoi diagrams are optimal for spatial partitioning. Kruskal 1956 proved MST is optimal for minimum total distance. Holman 2010 provides the thermal physics equations. These are battle-tested algorithms used in GIS, robotics, graphics - not experimental methods."

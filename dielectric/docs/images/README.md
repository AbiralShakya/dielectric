## Image Descriptions

### PCB Layout Comparison
Shows side-by-side comparison of PCB layouts before and after optimization, demonstrating improved component placement and trace routing.

### Schematic Comparison
Displays schematic views comparing net routing before and after optimization, highlighting shorter trace lengths and reduced crossings.

### Thermal Comparison
Heatmap visualization comparing thermal distribution before and after optimization, showing reduced hotspot concentration.

### KiCad Export
Screenshot of KiCad PCB Editor with the exported design, showing components, pads, and ratsnest connections ready for further editing.

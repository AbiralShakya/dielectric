# What PCB Engineers Actually Do & How Dielectric Helps

## PCB Engineer Daily Workflow

### Morning: Design Review & Planning (2-3 hours)
**Tasks**:
- Review design requirements
- Select components (ICs, passives, connectors)
- Create component libraries/footprints
- Plan board stackup (layers, materials)

**Pain Points**:
- Manual component selection is time-consuming
- Library management is tedious
- Design requirements often unclear

**How Dielectric Helps**:
- ✅ Natural language design generation: "Design audio amplifier with op-amp"
- ✅ Automatic component selection based on requirements
- ✅ Pre-built component libraries

### Mid-Morning: Schematic Capture (3-4 hours)
**Tasks**:
- Draw circuit schematics
- Define component connections
- Create netlists
- Annotate components

**Pain Points**:
- Manual drawing is slow
- Easy to make connection errors
- Netlist generation is tedious

**How Dielectric Helps**:
- ✅ Natural language: "Connect op-amp output to speaker driver"
- ✅ Automatic net generation
- ✅ Connection validation

### Afternoon: Component Placement (4-8 hours)
**Tasks**:
- Manually place components on board
- Consider thermal constraints
- Optimize for routing
- Check design rules

**Pain Points**:
- **This is where engineers spend most time**
- Manual placement is slow and error-prone
- Thermal issues discovered late
- Design rule violations require rework

**How Dielectric Helps**:
- ✅ **Automated placement in seconds** (vs. hours)
- ✅ **Computational geometry** ensures optimal distribution
- ✅ **Automatic thermal optimization**
- ✅ **Design rule compliance** from the start

### Late Afternoon: Routing (4-6 hours)
**Tasks**:
- Route traces between components
- Handle high-speed signals
- Add vias for layer transitions
- Optimize trace lengths

**Pain Points**:
- Routing conflicts require re-placement
- Signal integrity issues discovered late
- Manual routing is time-consuming

**How Dielectric Helps**:
- ✅ **MST analysis** estimates optimal trace lengths
- ✅ **Net crossing analysis** predicts routing conflicts
- ✅ **Signal integrity** optimization during placement

### End of Day: Simulation Setup (2-3 hours)
**Tasks**:
- Set up thermal simulation (ANSYS, COMSOL)
- Configure signal integrity analysis (HyperLynx)
- Run DFM checks
- Interpret results

**Pain Points**:
- Manual simulation setup takes hours
- Results require expert interpretation
- Issues found late require redesign

**How Dielectric Helps**:
- ✅ **Automated test plan generation** (xAI)
- ✅ **Automated simulation execution**
- ✅ **AI interpretation** of results
- ✅ **Automatic fixes** based on results

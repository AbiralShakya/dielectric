## How to Make It the Best for HackPrinceton

### 1. Showcase Computational Geometry Impact

**What to demonstrate**:
- **Before optimization**: Show geometry metrics (high Voronoi variance, long MST)
- **After optimization**: Show improved metrics (lower variance, shorter MST)
- **Explain why**: Computational geometry provides objective metrics that xAI can reason over

**Demo script**:
1. Load iPhone Speaker & Siri design
2. Show initial geometry: "MST length: 250mm, Voronoi variance: 0.8"
3. Run optimization: "Optimize for thermal management"
4. Show improved geometry: "MST length: 180mm, Voronoi variance: 0.3"
5. Explain: "Computational geometry metrics guide xAI to make better decisions"

### 2. Highlight Time Savings

**Add timing to frontend**:
- Show optimization time: "Optimized in 2.3 seconds"
- Compare to traditional: "Traditional: 2-3 weeks"
- Calculate savings: "2,000x faster"

**Display in UI**:
```
Optimization Time: 2.3 seconds
Traditional Time: 2-3 weeks
Time Savings: 2,000x faster
```

### 3. Demonstrate Multi-Agent Workflow

**Show agent activity**:
- IntentAgent: "Analyzing geometry... Generating weights"
- LocalPlacerAgent: "Optimizing placement... 200 iterations"
